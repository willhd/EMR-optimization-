# Medical Records Optimization & Data Driven Interventions

 As a contract Data Scientist for a medical-records company I built a data-optimization pipeline that extracts structured information from clinical notes using NLP and latent dirichlet allocation topic modeling. Additionally, I built a tool for our users that utilizes supervised machine learning to predict the probability of annual hospitalization given the contents of a specified medical note. This tool is estimated to save up $2,500 per patient annually by targeting preventative interventions for patients most at risk for hospitalization.

## Background
This project was built for the purpose of optimizing information exchange in health care.

Capstone project for Data Science Immersive at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/seattle/data-science|Galvanize) in Seattle.

### Objectives
>Extract structured data from unstructured medical texts through a secure AWS python integrated class

>Deploy NLP and topic modeling to label medical encounters

>Model the probability of a specified encounter resulting in hospitalization.

>Deploy structured database with models as sustainable secure software on cloud
